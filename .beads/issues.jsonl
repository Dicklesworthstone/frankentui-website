{"id":"bd-11i","title":"Epic: React FrankenTerminal Widget Component","description":"GOAL: Create a React component that wraps the FrankenTUI WASM terminal so it can be embedded as a widget inside normal React pages — not full-screen, but as a bounded, resizable element alongside other content. This is fundamentally different from the /web full-page integration (Epic bd-ty6) which serves the raw standalone HTML. The widget version must: (1) Be a proper 'use client' React component with props-based configuration. (2) Handle WASM module lifecycle (load, init, destroy) within React mount/unmount. (3) Forward DOM events (keyboard, mouse, wheel, clipboard, focus) through the WASM bridge. (4) Support responsive sizing (fill parent container, or fixed dimensions). (5) Provide loading states and error boundaries compatible with the site's design system. USE CASES: (a) Embed a live terminal preview on the homepage or showcase page. (b) Show specific demo screens inline (e.g. ?screen=3 for the dashboard). (c) Allow visitors to interact with FrankenTUI without leaving the page context. TECHNICAL CHALLENGES: (a) WASM module singletons — can we have multiple instances? The FrankenTermWeb and ShowcaseRunner seem to support single-instance per canvas. (b) Keyboard capture — when the widget has focus, it captures all keys (preventing page scroll, browser shortcuts). Need a focus/blur boundary. (c) WebGPU context per canvas — each widget needs its own GPU context. (d) Memory management — WASM instances are not garbage collected; explicit destroy() needed on unmount. (e) Bundle size — the WASM binaries (3.4MB) should be lazy-loaded only when the widget mounts, not in the main bundle. DEPENDENCY: The WASM assets must already be in public/web/ (from Epic bd-ty6). The widget loads them from the same paths.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2026-02-11T03:00:04.593495732Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-02-11T03:48:42.266077995Z","closed_at":"2026-02-11T03:48:42.265973339Z","source_repo":".","compaction_level":0,"original_size":0}

This is separated from the React component to keep concerns clean and allow reuse. RESPONSIBILITIES: (1) Lazy-load the FrankenTerm.js and ftui_showcase_wasm.js ES modules from /web/pkg/. (2) Download and compile the .wasm binaries (FrankenTerm_bg.wasm, ftui_showcase_wasm_bg.wasm). (3) Initialize both modules (call their default() init functions). (4) Cache the loaded modules so multiple FrankenTerminal widgets don't re-download WASM. (5) Provide a clean API: loadWasmModules(): Promise<{ FrankenTermWeb, ShowcaseRunner }>. (6) Handle errors gracefully (network failures, WASM compilation errors, WebGPU unavailable). (7) Optionally preload the font (Pragmasevka NF from /web/fonts/). (8) Optionally load large text assets (shakespeare, sqlite) on demand. PATTERN: Use a module-level promise cache. First call triggers the download; subsequent calls return the cached promise. Example: let cached: Promise<WasmModules> | null = null; export function loadWasmModules() { if (\\!cached) cached = doLoad(); return cached; }. IMPORTANT NUANCE: The WASM JS glue modules (FrankenTerm.js, ftui_showcase_wasm.js) use ES module dynamic import().

We may need to use fetch() + eval() or create a <script> tag, OR configure Next.js to pass them through. Test this carefully. FALLBACK: If ES module import fails, try: const script = document.createElement('script'); script.type = 'module'; ... or fetch the JS and use new Function().

PRIMARY WORKAROUND (use this, not the import() approach): Inject a <script type='module'> tag into the DOM that loads the JS glue from the public/ URL. This bypasses the bundler entirely. The script runs in the browser's native ES module context where import.meta.url resolves correctly. Pattern: const script = document.createElement('script'); script.type = 'module'; script.src = '/web/pkg/FrankenTerm.js'; document.head.appendChild(script); Wait for load event, then access the exports via globalThis.

FILE: components/frankentui-terminal.tsx (single file, following the project convention of keeping components in the components/ directory). IMPLEMENTATION PLAN: (1) MOUNT PHASE: useEffect on mount → call loadWasmModules() → create FrankenTermWeb instance → call term.init(canvasRef, config) → create ShowcaseRunner → apply initial patches → term.render() → start rAF loop. (2) UNMOUNT PHASE: Stop rAF loop → runner.destroy() → cleanup event listeners → release GPU context. Use useRef for rAF ID and AbortController for cleanup. (3) CANVAS REF: Use useRef<HTMLCanvasElement> to get the canvas DOM element. The canvas must be in the DOM before term.init() is called. (4) CONTAINER SIZING: Wrap the canvas in a div with the user-specified width/height. Use ResizeObserver (via useEffect) to detect container size changes and call term.fitToContainer() + runner.resize(). (5) LOADING STATE: Show loading UI (progress bar or custom component) while WASM loads. Track loading state with useState. (6) ERROR STATE: Catch errors from WASM load/init, store in state, render error UI. (7) rAF LOOP: Port the frame() function from the vanilla JS. Each frame: runner.advanceTime(dt) → drain inputs → runner.step() → apply patches → term.render(). Use useRef for the loop state (lastTs, totalFrames, running). (8) STRICT MODE COMPATIBILITY: React 18/19 strict mode double-mounts components in dev. Handle this: either use a ref flag to prevent double-init, or properly cleanup and re-init on the second mount. CRITICAL: The component must be marked 'use client' at the top. It uses browser APIs (canvas, WebAssembly, ResizeObserver, requestAnimationFrame) that are not available in SSR.

The vanilla JS demo uses window-level event listeners that capture ALL input. The React widget version must be scoped to only capture input when the widget has focus, to avoid hijacking the page. EVENTS TO FORWARD (from the vanilla JS source): (1) KEYBOARD: keydown/keyup → domKeyToInput() → term.input(). Must handle: key, code, modifiers (shift/alt/ctrl/meta), repeat flag. Must EXCLUDE IME composition events (isComposing check). Must handle Ctrl+/- for zoom (keep this or make it optional via props). (2) MOUSE: mousedown/mouseup/mousemove on canvas → domMouseToInput(). Maps pixel coordinates to terminal cell coordinates using canvas bounds and current cols/rows. (3) WHEEL: wheel on canvas → domWheelToInput(). Needs passive: false to prevent page scroll when scrolling inside the terminal. (4) CLIPBOARD: paste event → { kind: 'paste', data: text }. (5) FOCUS: canvas focus/blur → { kind: 'focus', focused: bool }. Also window blur/focus and document visibility change. (6) IME: compositionstart/update/end for international input. SCOPING STRATEGY: (a) Keyboard events: add listeners to the canvas element (not window), so they only fire when canvas is focused. But some keys (Tab, arrow keys) need the canvas to have tabindex and explicit focus management. (b) Mouse events: already scoped to canvas naturally. (c) Wheel: scope to canvas. (d) Paste: scope to canvas or handle via onPaste React prop. (e) Focus: track canvas focus state, not window focus.

{"id":"bd-11i.5","title":"Implement responsive container sizing for FrankenTerminal widget","description":"Make the FrankenTerminal widget properly resize when its container changes dimensions. The full-page demo uses window resize + ResizeObserver on the container div. The widget version needs more nuanced behavior because it's embedded in a layout that may reflow. REQUIREMENTS: (1) INITIAL SIZING: On mount, measure the container div's clientWidth/clientHeight. Call term.fitToContainer(w, h, dpr) to compute optimal cols/rows for the available space. (2) RESIZE OBSERVATION: Attach a ResizeObserver to the container div. On resize, re-fit and resize the runner. Debounce slightly (50ms) to avoid excessive recomputation during drag-resize. (3) DPR CHANGES: Handle device pixel ratio changes (monitor switching, zoom). Use visualViewport API or matchMedia fallback. (4) ASPECT RATIO: The terminal has a natural aspect ratio based on cols × cellWidth / rows × cellHeight. When the container doesn't match, the canvas should letterbox (black bars) or crop, not stretch. The current fitToContainer() likely handles this, but verify. (5) MINIMUM SIZE: Below some threshold (e.g., 40 cols × 12 rows), the terminal becomes unusable. Show a 'too small' message instead of a broken terminal. (6) CSS CONTAINMENT: Add 'contain: strict' or 'contain: layout size' to the container div for performance isolation — prevents the widget's layout from affecting the rest of the page. (7) PIXEL-PERFECT CANVAS: The canvas element's width/height attributes must be set to physical pixel dimensions (clientWidth × dpr), while CSS width/height match the container.

An interactive WASM terminal would be far more impressive, letting visitors actually interact with FrankenTUI. But: the 3.4MB WASM load might slow initial page load. Consider: lazy-load the widget only when it scrolls into view (IntersectionObserver trigger). (b) SHOWCASE PAGE (app/showcase/page.tsx) — Add an interactive demo section alongside the existing screenshots and videos. This is a natural fit: 'Don't just look at screenshots — try it live.' (c) ARCHITECTURE PAGE (app/architecture/page.tsx) — Embed a small terminal showing specific screens (e.g., the dashboard or diff view) to illustrate architectural concepts with live examples. RECOMMENDATION: Start with the SHOWCASE page. Add a new section (using SectionShell with icon='terminal' or similar) titled 'Interactive Demo' that contains a FrankenTerminal widget at a reasonable size (e.g., 100% width, 500px height). Include a brief description explaining what the user is seeing and how to interact (Tab to switch screens, number keys for direct navigation). IMPORTANT: The widget must be lazy-loaded.

This is not just 'add a nav link and some CTAs' — this is a fundamental repositioning of FrankenTUI's value proposition. CONTEXT & STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE: FrankenTUI running in the browser via WASM+WebGPU means it's not just a Ratatui/Crossterm replacement for native terminals — it's also a replacement for xterm.js in the browser. This is a massive expansion of FrankenTUI's addressable market and use cases. The landing page must communicate this clearly and compellingly. Currently the homepage hero shows a pre-recorded video. The /web demo is orders of magnitude more impressive because visitors can INTERACT with it live. WHAT 'PROMINENT' MEANS: (1) The hero section should lead with or prominently feature the live demo capability. (2) A dedicated section should explain the browser story (WASM+WebGPU, works in Chrome/Edge, full 60fps terminal in the browser). (3) Comparison positioning: FrankenTUI vs xterm.js / vs other browser terminals — show why FrankenTUI's approach (real TUI kernel compiled to WASM with GPU rendering) is superior to DOM-based terminal emulators. (4) The 'Try the Live Demo' CTA should be one of the first things visitors see, not buried below the fold. (5) Feature badges/stats should include 'Runs in Browser' alongside the existing stats.

CURRENT STATE: The hero section has animated stats (workspace crates, build time, algorithms, throughput), a title, a subtitle, and links to Getting Started + GitHub. Below it is a video demo section showing a pre-recorded Rio CRT video. PROPOSED CHANGES: (1) ADD A PRIMARY CTA BUTTON: 'Try It Live in Your Browser →' (or 'Launch Live Demo') as the FIRST and most prominent button, above or alongside the existing 'Get Started' button. Style it distinctively — possibly with a pulsing glow or the green accent color, larger than other buttons. It's the single most compelling action a visitor can take. (2) ADD A HERO STAT: Replace one of the 4 hero stats or add a 5th: 'Runs in Browser' or 'WebGPU Native' or '60fps in Browser'. This immediately signals the browser capability. (3) ENHANCE THE SUBTITLE: Current subtitle probably mentions terminal/TUI. Add browser capability: 'The Rust TUI kernel that runs everywhere — terminal AND browser.' (4) OPTIONAL - LIVE PREVIEW: Consider replacing the static video with a small embedded FrankenTerminal widget showing a demo screen (e.g., dashboard). This is the ultimate flex — the hero itself is a live terminal. But: this loads 3.4MB of WASM on page load, which hurts LCP.

(2) KEY POINTS (3-4 cards or bullets): (a) 'Real TUI, Not a Toy' — FrankenTUI compiles to WASM via wasm-pack. The same Rust code that runs natively also runs in the browser. No reimplementation, no subset. (b) 'WebGPU Rendering at 60fps' — Terminal cells rendered via the GPU, not the DOM. This means no layout thrashing, no text node soup, no CSS recalc. Just raw pixel-perfect rendering. (c) 'Full Input Support' — Keyboard, mouse, wheel, clipboard, IME. The browser demo handles all the same input as a native terminal. (d) 'Deterministic and Testable' — Same patch-based rendering pipeline. What you see in the browser is exactly what you'd see in a native terminal. (3) COMPARISON CALLOUT: Brief comparison with xterm.js approach: xterm.js = DOM-based emulator + escape sequence parser. FrankenTUI = real TUI application kernel compiled to WASM + GPU rendering. The architectural difference is profound. (4) CTA: 'Try the live demo →' button. IMPLEMENTATION: Add to app/page.tsx as a new section. Use SectionShell with an appropriate icon (Globe, Monitor, or Laptop from lucide-react — check the icon map and add if needed). Add content data to lib/content.ts. Place this section high on the page — after the hero and features, but BEFORE the existing video/screenshot sections. It should be one of the first things a scrolling visitor sees. DESIGN: Consider using FrankenContainer (bolts + stitches) for visual emphasis. Maybe a split layout: text on left, a screenshot or embedded widget on right.","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-02-11T03:07:27.574525381Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-02-11T03:30:05.544154534Z","closed_at":"2026-02-11T03:30:05.544130759Z","close_reason":"Added full 'Works in Browser' section to homepage between features and screenshots.

This content will be used by the homepage browser section and possibly the architecture page. DATA TO ADD TO lib/content.ts: (1) browserComparisonData — array of comparison rows, similar to existing comparisonData (which compares vs Ratatui/Crossterm). Columns: Feature, FrankenTUI (WASM), xterm.js, hterm. Rows should include: Rendering approach (GPU canvas vs DOM), Frame rate (60fps deterministic vs variable), Input model (full keyboard/mouse/IME vs escape sequences), Architecture (compiled application kernel vs emulator+parser), Binary protocol (flat patches vs escape sequence stream), Resize behavior (reflow + re-render vs escape sequence), Testing (deterministic golden checksums vs screenshot diffs), Memory model (Rust ownership/RAII vs JS GC), Bundle size (3.4MB WASM vs ~800KB JS, but FrankenTUI includes the whole app). (2) browserAdvantages — array of {title, description, icon} for the key advantages of the WASM+WebGPU approach. (3) browserUseCases — array of use cases: web-based terminal apps, embeddable TUI widgets, interactive documentation, demo/showcase pages. WHY THIS MATTERS: Most developers know xterm.js as THE way to do terminals in the browser. FrankenTUI's approach is fundamentally different and better in many ways. We need to articulate this clearly. The comparison shouldn't be a takedown of xterm.js — it should explain the architectural difference and let readers draw their own conclusions.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-02-11T03:07:41.878284861Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-02-11T03:27:20.382527991Z","closed_at":"2026-02-11T03:27:20.382504808Z","close_reason":"Added browserComparisonData (9 comparison rows vs xterm.js and hterm), browserAdvantages (4 items: GPU rendering, real kernel, deterministic output, zero GC), and browserUseCases (4 items: web apps, embeddable widgets, interactive docs, demo pages).

This is the live, interactive, WebGPU-powered terminal demo that renders a full TUI app (FrankenTUI) in the browser via WASM+Canvas at 60fps. The demo is ~18MB total: 2 WASM binaries (384KB FrankenTerm terminal renderer + 2.8MB ftui_showcase_wasm demo runner), JS glue (103KB), a custom font (Pragmasevka NF, 18KB), and 2 large text assets (shakespeare.txt 5.4MB, sqlite3.c 8.8MB used by specific demo screens). All assets live in /dp/frankentui/dist/ as a self-contained static site built by build-wasm.sh. The dist/index.html uses all-relative paths (./pkg/, ./fonts/, ./assets/) so placing the whole tree under public/web/ means Next.js serves it with zero path rewriting needed for internal references. KEY REQUIREMENT: Improvements to /dp/frankentui/ (new WASM builds, HTML changes) must flow automatically to frankentui.com deployments via a sync script + CI pipeline. APPROACH: (1) sync script copies /dp/frankentui/dist/ to website public/web/, (2) Next.js rewrite maps /web to the static index.html, (3) CI/CD triggers Vercel redeploy when frankentui WASM changes.

The script must: (1) Validate that /dp/frankentui/dist/ exists and contains expected files (index.html, pkg/, fonts/, assets/). (2) Create public/web/ if it doesn't exist. (3) Use rsync --delete to mirror the entire dist/ tree, ensuring removed files upstream are also removed here. (4) Print a summary of what was synced (file count, total size, timestamp). (5) Optionally accept a source path argument to override the default /dp/frankentui/dist/ for flexibility. (6) Be idempotent — safe to run multiple times. (7) Include a --dry-run flag.

Total ~18MB. WHY rsync: We want exact mirroring so if upstream removes a file or changes binary content, the website reflects it immediately.

The dist/index.html uses ALL relative paths (./pkg/, ./fonts/, ./assets/). Per RFC 3986, browsers resolve relative URLs against the 'base directory' of the current URL. For /web (no trailing slash), the base is / — so ./pkg/FrankenTerm.js resolves to /pkg/FrankenTerm.js, which is a 404 (files are at /web/pkg/). EVIDENCE: grep of dist/index.html shows 8+ relative path references: ./fonts/ (preload+CSS), ./assets/ (fetch), ./pkg/ (import+URL), import.meta.url (WASM resolution). All will break. FIX REQUIRED: Add a redirect BEFORE the rewrite in next.config.ts: async redirects() { return [{ source: '/web', destination: '/web/', permanent: true }]; }. Then change the rewrite to: { source: '/web/', destination: '/web/index.html' }. Result: visitor hits /web → 301 redirect to /web/ → rewrite serves /web/index.html → browser resolves ./pkg/X as /web/pkg/X (correct). ALTERNATIVE FIX: Add <base href='/web/'> to the dist/index.html head. But the redirect approach is better because (a) it fixes ALL relative references including CSS and JS, (b) it is the standard way to handle directory-like URLs, (c) it does not require modifying the upstream HTML. ALSO: Check if Next.js trailingSlash config is relevant — setting trailingSlash: true globally would add trailing slashes to ALL routes, which we may not want. The per-route redirect approach is more surgical.

DECISION NEEDED: Should the ~18MB of WASM/text assets be committed to git or gitignored? ANALYSIS: The largest files are shakespeare.txt (5.4MB) and sqlite3.c (8.8MB) — these are plain text and compress very well with git (probably ~2-3MB in packfiles). The WASM binaries are 384KB + 2.8MB. Total uncompressed ~18MB, git-compressed probably ~5-6MB. This is well within GitHub's limits (100MB per file, no hard repo size limit though >1GB gets warnings). RECOMMENDATION: Commit everything. Rationale: (a) Vercel builds need the files present in the repo (no local filesystem access). (b) The compressed git overhead is modest (~5-6MB). (c) Keeping them in git means the sync-and-commit workflow is trivial: run sync script, git add public/web/, git commit, push, Vercel auto-deploys. (d) Git LFS is overkill for this size and adds deployment complexity.

{"id":"bd-ty6.3","title":"Add Next.js rewrite and static asset config for /web route","description":"Configure Next.js to serve the WASM showcase demo at frankentui.com/web. THREE THINGS NEEDED: (1) TRAILING SLASH REDIRECT: This is CRITICAL. The dist/index.html uses all-relative paths (./pkg/, ./fonts/, ./assets/). Browsers resolve relative URLs based on the visible URL path. If a user visits /web (no trailing slash), the browser treats / as the parent directory, so ./pkg/FrankenTerm.js resolves to /pkg/FrankenTerm.js — which is a 404. The fix: add a redirect in next.config.ts: { source: '/web', destination: '/web/', permanent: true }. This ensures the browser always sees /web/ (WITH trailing slash), making ./pkg/X resolve to /web/pkg/X correctly. (2) REWRITE FOR INDEX: Next.js does not auto-serve public/web/index.html when visiting /web/. Add a rewrite: { source: '/web/', destination: '/web/index.html' }. Order matters: the redirect from (1) fires first, then the rewrite from (2) serves the file. Together: /web → 301 → /web/ → rewrite → /web/index.html. (3) CACHE HEADERS: Add headers() config for aggressive caching of WASM, font, and text assets. WASM and font files should get Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable. The HTML uses ASSET_VERSION query params for cache-busting, so immutable is safe. Pattern: { source: '/web/pkg/:path*', headers: [{ key: 'Cache-Control', value: 'public, max-age=31536000, immutable' }] }. Same for /web/fonts/:path* and /web/assets/:path*. ALSO VERIFY: (a) .wasm files served with Content-Type: application/wasm (Next.js handles this for public/ files, but verify). (b) .woff2 files get font/woff2. (c) No CORS headers needed (same-origin). MODIFICATION TARGET: next.config.ts — add async redirects(), async rewrites(), and async headers() functions. Keep existing config (images, compress, poweredByHeader, reactStrictMode) intact. TESTING: After implementation, verify in browser Network tab that: (a) /web returns 301 to /web/, (b) /web/ loads index.html, (c) all asset requests go to /web/pkg/, /web/fonts/, /web/assets/ (not /pkg/, /fonts/, /assets/).","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-02-11T02:58:11.712366303Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-02-11T03:23:40.874672057Z","closed_at":"2026-02-11T03:23:40.874645768Z","close_reason":"Added rewrite rule (/web -> /web/index.html) and Cache-Control headers for pkg/ (immutable), fonts/ (immutable), and assets/ (1 day).

{"id":"bd-ty6.6","title":"Create OG/Twitter share image for /web route","description":"Create a social share card image for frankentui.com/web. When someone shares the demo URL on Twitter/Discord/Slack, they should see an appealing preview that communicates 'live interactive terminal in your browser'. PRIMARY APPROACH (static PNG): Generate a static og.png image (1200x630) and place it in the dist/ directory at dist/og.png. The sync script copies it to public/web/og.png. The meta tags in the HTML (bd-ty6.7) point to https://frankentui.com/web/og.png. This approach is simple and reliable — no conflicts with Next.js rewrites. HOW TO GENERATE: Use the existing OG image generation pattern. Run the Satori/ImageResponse logic once locally (via a script or temporary route), save the output as a static PNG, and commit it to the frankentui dist/. Or create it manually in an image editor. Key constraints from MEMORY.md: (a) Satori does NOT support WebP — output must be PNG. (b) No borderRadius: 'full' — use '9999px'. (c) Every element needs display: 'flex'. The image should convey: FrankenTUI running live in a browser, WebGPU-powered, interactive. TEXT SUGGESTIONS: Title 'FrankenTUI Live Demo', subtitle 'Interactive WASM terminal — runs in your browser', FrankenTUI branding. Consider using a terminal screenshot as the background. WHY NOT app/web/opengraph-image.tsx: The /web route uses a redirect (/web → /web/) + rewrite (/web/ → /web/index.html). Placing a Next.js route handler at app/web/ would conflict with this rewrite — Next.js would try to serve the route handler instead of the static file. A static PNG avoids this entirely and is more reliable across CDN/cache layers. CROSS-REPO: The og.png should live in /dp/frankentui/dist/og.png so it syncs with other assets. Alternatively, generate it in the website repo at public/web/og.png (outside the sync pipeline) and add it to .gitignore exceptions.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-02-11T02:58:56.754000178Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-02-11T03:34:01.955134654Z","closed_at":"2026-02-11T03:34:01.955110189Z","close_reason":"Generated static og.png (1200x630, 85KB) at public/web/og.png using sharp + SVG.

IMPORTANT: This change must be made in the SOURCE HTML at /dp/frankentui/frankentui_showcase_demo.html (or in the dist generation pipeline), NOT just in public/web/index.html, because the sync script would overwrite local-only changes. The dist/index.html is a derivative of the source HTML — either modify the source to include these tags, or have build-wasm.sh inject them.

PURPOSE: (1) Debug aid — when a deployment has issues, fetch /web/version.json to check which exact WASM build is deployed. (2) Cache-busting validation — the ASSET_VERSION in the HTML should match what was built. (3) Drift detection — the update-web-demo.sh workflow script (ty6.9) can compare git SHAs to decide if a re-sync is needed. (4) Audit trail — know exactly when the last sync happened. The manifest is tiny (<2KB) and should be committed alongside the synced assets. IMPLEMENTATION: Add a generate_manifest() function to sync-showcase.sh that runs after rsync completes.

IMPORTANT: GitHub Actions are NOT available (account restricted for overuse). All automation must be local-only. WORKFLOW STEPS: (1) cd to frankentui repo, run build-wasm.sh (compiles Rust to WASM). (2) Run sync-showcase.sh to copy dist/ to website's public/web/. (3) Run version manifest generation (from bd-ty6.8). (4) In website repo: git add public/web/, git commit -m 'chore(web): sync WASM showcase [SHA]'. (5) git push to trigger Vercel auto-deploy (Vercel watches the main branch). (6) Optionally: use Vercel CLI 'vercel --prod' for immediate deploy without waiting for git push hook. ALTERNATIVE TRIGGER MECHANISMS (no GH Actions needed): (a) Vercel Deploy Hooks — create a webhook URL in Vercel dashboard, curl it to trigger rebuild. (b) Vercel CLI — 'vercel deploy --prod' directly from local. (c) Git push — simplest, Vercel auto-deploys on push to main. SCRIPT REQUIREMENTS: (1) Accept --dry-run flag (show what would happen). (2) Accept --skip-build flag (if WASM was already built, just sync). (3) Accept --no-push flag (commit locally but don't push). (4) Validate both repos exist and are clean (no uncommitted changes). (5) Print timing for each step. (6) Exit with meaningful error codes. (7) Log everything to stdout with timestamps. WHY A SINGLE SCRIPT: The manual workflow of 'build WASM, sync, commit, push' is 4-5 separate commands that must be run in order.
